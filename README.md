# Backend Performance test in different languages

With each language, I will add 1 from scratch and maybe 1 or more with framework

You can help too

**Please do not add Javascript and Typescript**

Ok you can use it but no libraries for JS/TS allowed like express, koala etc

## Next to adds:

> Rust
>
> Zig
>
> Java/ Kotlin
>
> Scala (Maybe)
>
> Big/ Full stack frameworks not allowed like Rails, Nest, Pheonix, Laravel

> [!NOTE]
> You can add languages that are already in here but they need to be do things little differently like using a library

### Ideas

> Go + Gin
>
> C++ + http library from github
>
> Frontend in different languages
>
> **Add your language by backend-{language}-{framework}**
